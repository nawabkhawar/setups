For new Linux users this could be a daunting task. Let me update this with MySQL 8 (the latest version available right now is 8.0.12 as on 2018-09-12)

Open "mysqld.cnf" configuration file at "/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/".
Add skip-grant-tables to the next line of [mysql] text and save.
Restart the MySQL service as "sudo service mysql restart". Now your MySQL is free of any authentication.
Connect to the MySQL client (also known as mysql-shell) as mysql -u root -p. There is no password to be keyed in as of now.
Run SQL command flush privileges;
Reset the password now as ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPassword';
Now let's get back to the normal state; remove that line "skip-grant-tables" from "mysqld.cnf" and restart the service.
